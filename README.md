  - Detail the loss functions used (e.g., mean squared error, logistic loss).
  - Explain why these loss functions are appropriate for your models.
- **Model Validation**:
  - Describe how the dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Provide the sizes of each set and the rationale behind these choices.

## **Results**

- **Training and Validation Errors**:
  - Present and compare the errors obtained from all ML methods considered.
- **Final Chosen Method**:
  - Identify the final model selected.
  - Explain why this model was chosen over others.

## **Installation and Usage**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.12.6**

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henryblu/data_science_project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd data_science_project
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Running the Project**

- **Jupyter Notebooks**:

  Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the notebooks:

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

  Open the notebooks located in `notebooks/exploratory/` or `notebooks/final/` to interact with the code.

- **Data Preprocessing**:

  Run the data preprocessing script:

  ```bash
  python src/data_preprocessing.py
  ```

- **Model Training**:

  Train the machine learning models:

  ```bash
  python src/model_training.py
  ```

- **Evaluation**:

  Evaluate the trained models:

  ```bash
  python src/evaluation.py
  ```

### **Data Preparation**

- **Dataset Access**:

  - Place the raw dataset files into the `data/raw/` directory.
  - If the dataset is large, provide instructions or scripts in `src/` to download it.

- **Preprocessing Steps**:

  - Run `data_preprocessing.py` to clean and preprocess the raw data.
  - Processed data will be saved in `data/processed/`.
